# Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule for Women’s Issues?
## Sean Hughes, Gabe Walker, Keeley MacAfee

This repository includes replication of the code and data used by Adam N. Glynn and Maya Sen in the article "Identifying Judicial Empathy: Does Having Daughters Cause Judges to Rule for Women’s Issues?" We replicated the tables and the figure the authors use in the article to support their claim that judges with daughters tend to vote in a more feminist direction on gender issues compared to their counterparts who only have sons.
